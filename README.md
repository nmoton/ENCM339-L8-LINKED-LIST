# ENCM339-L8-P
In Lab 8, students were assigned to design and code a C++ program that read data from a text file
(an integer year in the format YYYY, followed by a double pipe flow value corresponding to that year),
and organize it into a linked list.

This program was expected to have five selectable menu options for the end-user. Option 1 allowed the 
end-user to view the organized linked list (in order from lowest pipe flow value, to highest pipe flow value)
on the screen. Option 2 allowed the end-user to add values to the linked list, requiring a year and pipe flow
value. Option 3 allowed the end-user to save the added/removed values of the linked list to the text file.
Option 4 allowed the end-user to delete any values from the linked list based on the year. Lastly, option 5
allowed the end-user to exit the program safely.

In order to test the program, you are required to have the files: flow.txt, hydro.cpp, hydro.h, list.cpp, list.h

This program was written by both Nathan Moton, and Andrew Bright in C++, on November 2017.

Restricted code was accidentally uploaded to the original repository with the original commits. Thus, a new one was created instead.
